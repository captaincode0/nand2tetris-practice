# nand2tetris-practice

This repository contains all the projects, to acquire knowledge in the course Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris, at coursera MOOC platform.

The course theach how to build a modern computer from basic principles, using logic gates to make chips, registers, assembly language, till do the base simulated hardware of one computer.
